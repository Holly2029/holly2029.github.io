# Phonetic Phonics

I have debated a few days to write this article in English or Chinese. Later I decided to write it in English in order to share it with my English mentor, a British lady, who helped me open the door to the fantastic world of languages. In my previous post, no matter you believed me or not, I shared with you that every English sentence can be viewed in a unified sentence structure. Some more complex sentences are essentially nesting and paralleling of applying this exclusive equation. Today, I am going to tell you that I am and will be keeping learning and concluding. God is guiding me find some more amazing things in my feeling of linguistics. There are definitely some magic things also hiding in the vocabularies, the elements of sentences. 

## Phonetic Alphabets
You would never believe that you can pronounce almost all English words only base on **six simple rules**. This then builds up a mapping between your pronunciation and the spelling. Before that let's take a look at the **American phonetic alphabets**. Roughly speaking, the 26 English alphabets can be classified as vowels `a, e, i, o, u` and consonants for the rests. My understanding of this classification is simply due to the reason that the vowels' pronunciation could be varying while it's fixed for that of consonants. So we totally don't need to memory consonants, e.g., `s` is pronounced as `s`, `t` is also pronounced as `t` and so on.  Therefore, to handle all of the American phonetic alphabets, it suffices to know about the pronunciation of the five vowels. The pronunciations of the long and short vowels are listed in the following table.

| vowels       	| a    	| e    	| i    	| o    	| u         	|
|--------------	|------	|------	|------	|------	|-----------	|
| long vowels  	| [eɪ] 	| [i:] 	| [аɪ] 	| [oʊ] 	| [yu]/[u:] 	|
| short vowels 	| [æ]  	| [ɛ]  	| [ɪ]  	| [ɔ]  	| [ʌ]       	|

From the above table, we may surprisingly find that the long vowels are nothing but the pronunciations of the vowels themselves.  

**Remark:**  Here I should reminder you two common mistakes affected by our mother tongue Chinese.

1.  The long vowel of `a` is pronounced as itself `[eɪ]` and the short vowel of `a` is pronounced by opening your big mouth to pronounce `[æ]`. Now we suddenly find that usually `a` is not pronounced `啊` as that of the Pinyin system.
2. The second lesson is that `i` is pronounced as `[аɪ]` for its long vowel and `[ɪ]` for its short vowel. So `i` is not pronounced `[i:]`, which virtually is the long vowel of `e`. This common mistake actually is also due to the Pinyin system.  In short words, please do forget about `啊` for `a` and `[i:]` for `[i]`. But you should forgive me that there are always lots of exceptions.

## Rules

After the above journey in an entirely new understanding,  which could never be taught in our text books, of **American phonetic alphabets**, we will try to find **six** natural rules through several examples.

**Example 1:**  `hate` and `hat`.  

* **Comments:** We can easily see that the `a` in `hate` is pronounced the letter `a` itself with a long vowel `[eɪ]`. Why does the different thing happen on `hat`, whose `a` is a short vowel `[æ]`? The only difference of these two words is `e`, which is actually silent. It is due to the silence of `e` that the pronunciation time of the silent `e` will be added to the previous vowel `a`, which is now becoming a long vowel pronounced `[eɪ]` according to the above table for vowels.
* **Remark:** Before I knew this secret in `hate`, I mistakenly thought that the last two letters `te` of `hate` is pronounced `t-e=te` like `特`, which is once again affected by our mother language Chinese.

From Example 1, we may conclude two rules.

**Rule 1:** *We name this rule as **silent 'e'**. Once you find `vowel+consonant+e`, which is in the end of a word, the letter `e` is silent by adding its time to the previous `vowel` to make it become a *long vowel*.*

**Rule 2:** *We name this rule as **closed syllable**. Once you find `vowel+consonant`, which could not only in the end of a word but also a syllable, the vowel should be pronounced as a *short vowel*.*

* **Remark:** Like the sentences, every vocabulary is not just consist by single letters. In fact, it is grouped by syllables. Roughly speaking, each syllable contains at least one vowel. For example, the word `bottle` contains two syllables `bot` and `tle`. Here is a small trick that once you find a **double consonants**, e.g., `tt` in `bottle`, then you just confidently split the word between the double consonants to separate them into different syllables. One more thing that you can find from the first syllable `bot` is that it totally satisfies **Rule 2**. In detail, `ot` in `bot` is `vowel+consonant`, so the `o` is a short vowel pronounced as `[ɔ]`. 

**Example 2:** `table`.

* **Comment:** After checking the [Longman English Dictionary Online](http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/table_1), we know the word `table` consists two syllables `ta` and `ble`. 
	1. First, we can surely announce that the first syllable `ta` doesn't satisfy any one of **Rule 1 and 2**. But it seems to tell us that the vowel should be pronounced as a long vowel if it's in the end of a syllable. Intuitively, the letter `a` in `ta` is placed at the end of this syllable and there is no consonant blocking the vowel `a`. In what difference, our **Rule 2** yields that if  a vowel is blocked by a consonant then the vowel can only be pronounced shortly. Here there is no any barrier after the vowel `a`, or we can say the vowel `a` is open, so it of course should be pronounced longer.  Some more examples could be `he`, `she`, `we` and `do`, where the vowels are all open and not blocked by a consonant, with the pronunciations of their long vowels.
	2. Second, we cannot make sure whether the second syllable `ble` satisfies **Rule 1** or not. Suppose that the last letter `e` satisfies **Rule 1** `the silence e`, then it seems that the pronunciations of  `table` and `tabl` are more or less the same or close. Checking the dictionary tells us that the American phonetic symbol of the word `table` is `['teɪbəl]`. So we find that here `e` is not silent but is `[ə]`. It looks like that we secretly change the positions of `l` and `e` in the last two letters `le` and pronounce them as `[əl]`. Once again, we can conclude two more rules from this simple example.

**Rule 3:** *We name this rule as **open syllable**. In contrast to Rule 2, once you find a vowel placed in the end of a syllable, without being blocked by a consonant or in another word being open, the vowel should be pronounced as a *long vowel*.*

**Rule 4:** *We name this rule as **consonant+'le'**. Once you find `consonant+le` in the end of a word, you should pronounce `[əl]` for the last two letters `le`, as if you changed the positions of `l` and `e`.*

In the above, we just conclude the law of a single vowel in each time. What if we consider the combinations of vowels, you may find that there would be 25 possible choices as shown in the following table.

|     	|    	|    	|    	|    	|
|----	|----	|----	|----	|----	|
| aa 	| ae 	| **ai** 	| ao 	| au 	|
| **ea** 	| **ee** 	| ei 	| eo 	| eu 	|
| ia 	| **ie** 	| ii 	| io 	| iu 	|
| **oa** 	| **oe** 	| **oi** 	| **oo** 	| **ou** 	|
| ua 	| ue 	| ui 	| uo 	| uu 	|

 In view of the table, you may suddenly understand why they are so called diphthongs, whose name is due to the combinations of two vowels not the phonetic symbols.  The bold combinations are often used in vocabularies. Others are just rarely used. 
 
**Rule 5:** *The 9 **bold** combinations can be remembered as in three groups to form our fifth rule.*

1. **ai**, **ea** and **oa**. The second vowels are all silent. So they are pronounced as `[eɪ]`, `[i:] ` and `[oʊ]`, respectively. 
2. **ee**, **ie** and **oe**. They somehow fit our Rule 1 **silent 'e'**. So they are pronounced as `[i:]`, `[аɪ] ` and `[oʊ]`, respectively.
3. **oi**, **oo** and **ou**. These three combinations are true combinations of two vowels, since **oi** is pronounced as `[ɔɪ]`, **oo** is pronounced as `[u:]`, and **ou** is pronounced as `[ɔ:]`.

In our Rule 5, we combine two vowels together and find some common laws of such a kind of combinations. Is that possible to combine a vowel with a consonant to become a diphthongs? The answer is yes. And the consonant is just the letter `r`. Thus we have the following five combinations for `vowel+r`.

|  	|  	|  	|  	|   	|
|----	|----	|----	|----	|---	|
| **ar** 	| **er** 	| **ir** 	| **or** 	|  **ur** 	|

We may find **ar** has exactly the same pronunciation as the letter `r` itself. The other four can be easily pronounced. So we arrive at our last rule.

**Rule 6:**  *We name this rule as **vowel+'r'**.*

1. **ar** = `[аr]`; **er** = `[ɛr]`; **ir** = `[ɪr]`; **or** = `[ɔr]`; **ur** = `[ʊr]`.
2. Note that if they are placed in the end of a word, sometimes they will be pronounced as `[ɝ]`, e.g., **her** = `[hɝ]` .

**Concluding Remarks:** As in an environment only emphasising  the sense of language, we are unfortunate. But we are still fortunate, since we are in a majestic time to be awaking in someday as long as we start to think using our own brains.
