# Stress and Syllables

This note serves as a supplementary of the previous post about the phonetic phonics. The previous blog suggests six rules to pronounce a wide range of English words based on the spelling. It would be a truly amazing thing if we can spell any words by their pronunciation and inversely pronounce any words by their spelling. I know even with such a constructive method it is still far from the whole story of phonics. Therefore, I did some research and found several elementary rules to easily place stresses and divide words.

## Stress

##### Rule # 1: With most nouns and adjectives with 2 syllables, the stress is on the first syllable.

PRO-gress,  PRE-sent,  EN-gine,  IN-crease,  RE-cord,  JEA-lous,  CAU-tious,  AW-kward,  PLEA-sant  

##### Rule # 2: With most verbs with 2 syllables, the stress is on the last syllable.

pre-SENT,  in-CREASE,  ad-MIT,  an-NOUNCE,  be-GIN,  ar-RANGE,  im-PRESS,  de-CIDE,  re-CORD

##### Rule # 3: The words ending in -TION, -SION, -CIAN are usually stressed on the second last syllable.

e-du-CA-tion,  in-tu-I-tion,  con-cen-TRA-tion,  de-mons-TRA-tion,  per-MIS-sion,  ob-SES-sion,  mu-SI-cian,  ma-GI-cian,  tech-NI-cian,  TE-le-vi-sion (exception)  

##### Rule # 4: Words ending in -IC are usually stressed on the second last syllable.

e-co-NO-mic,  rea-LIS-tic,  stra-TE-gic,  me-CHA-mic,  geo-GRA-phic,  dra-MA-tic,  pes-si-MIS-tic,  a-ca-DE-mic,  po-E-tic,  e-LEC-tric  

##### Rule # 5: Words ending in -EE and -OO are usually stressed on the last syllable.

em-ploy-EE,  gua-ran-TEE,  de-GREE,  sham-POO,  tat-TOO,  ta-BOO,  com-MIT-tee (exception),  COF-fee (exception)  

## Dividing Syllables

##### Rule 1: Split up word that have 2 middle consonants

Bas-ket, Let-ter, Din-ner

##### Rule 2: Usually divide before a single middle consonant

O-pen, E-xit

##### Rule 3: Divide before the consonant before an -le

A-ble, Fum-ble, Rub-ble

##### Rule 4: Divide off any compound word, prefix and suffix
