# A Thought on English


## English is Nothing but a Transformation of Chinese 


Last Friday (24 April, 2015) is undoubtely a remarkable day in my life, since on that day I got a whole new understanding of English by an extremely inspired online open course. What the video delivered, in short, is to transform English to Chinese in a fixed way, and vice versa. I get a huge kick out of writing down the details to share this thankful feeling. 

------

Grammatically, the component parts of sentences mainly include `subject`, `predicate`, `object`, `attribute` and `adverbial`, where  `subject` and `predicate` are necessary, `object` is secondarily, and both `attribute` and `adverbial` are unnessary. Let's first take a look at the following example.

## Examples

 **Example 1:** I love you.

* **Components:** `subject` I `predicate` love `object` you.
* **Comments:** We can learn from this example that for any declarative sentence the order of  `subject`,  `predicate` and `object` is always ordered as `subject`->`predicate`->`object`. Such an order of  `subject`,  `predicate` and `object` in English is exactly the same as in Chinese. Now I finally know why I did well in English when I was a pupil, at that time the only difference between Chinese and English is just characters and pronunciations.

Once I became a middle school student, unfortunately, the consistency in Chinese and English shown in Example 1 doesn't exist anylonger. We had been taught all kinds of grammatical rules and structures by our English teachers while no one told us the connections with Chinese our monther tongue.  Although we can figure out each word, we could be easily defeated by any sentence that seems long. E.g.,
 
**Example 2:** Although not so world widely accepted, people who are emotionally weak in daily business are often losers who are not able to fulfill any fruitful achievements in their lifetime that they endure.

* **Components:** `adverbial-1` [Although not so world widely accepted,] `subject` people `attribute-1` [who are emotionally weak in daily business] `predicate` are `adverbial-2` often `object` losers `attribute-2` [who are not able to fulfill any fruitful achievements in their lifetime that they endure].
* **Supplementary:** `attribute` and `adverbial` are always composed by
 1. Prepositional phrases
 2. Clauses
 3. The participial constructions
* **More details:** The above supplementary suggests that `attribute-1` and  `attribute-2` in the analysis of components could be divided in details according to the above three classes. `adverbial-1` is a prepositional phrase, so it cannot be devided anymore. For `attribute-1` and  `attribute-2`, we have
 1.  `attribute-1` [1) who are emotionally weak 2) in daily business]
 2.  `attribute-2` [1) who are not able to fulfill any fruitful achievements 2) in their lifetime 3) that they endure]. Note that '*to fulfill*' is fundamentally a phrase '*be able to*', so the partition cannot be placed before '*to*'.

Comparing Example 2 with Example 1, it can be easily seen that the oder of  `subject`,  `predicate` and `object` still keeps the same no matter how complex the sentence would be. Then we can conclude that Example 1 is just a simlification of Example 2.  It would be so great if Example 2 were the most general one and all the English sentences satisfied the same structure as Example 2. It can be so if you pray sincerely. Inspired by Example 2, we first assert the follows as "fact".

## Formulae

**Formula 1:** The structure of any **English** sentence satisfies

	(adverbial-1)[subject](attribute-1)[predicate](adverbial-2)(object)(attribute-2/adverbial-1)

* *Remarks:* 
 
  1. The parentheses `( )` means the corresponding components could be omitted. And the square brackets `[ ]` is used to emphasis that the related components are necessaily in forming a basic stentence.
  2. In Formula 1, `adverbial-1` appears two times due to the reason that `adverbial-1` could be placed either head or tail. For instance, one can see from Example 2 that `adverbial-1` [Although not so world widely accepted,] obviously can also be put in the end of the sentence as long as it reads smoothly.
  3. Clever readers may find that the structures of `[subject](attribute-1)` and `(object)(attribute-2)` are essentially the same thing. It should be intuitively a truth as is shown in Example 1 `I love you` where `I` and `You` must be equal in every way. Otherwise, it's not love but an unrequited one.
* *Connections with Chinese:* As a Chinese whose first langue is Chinese, the follows three features in Chinese should be understood without any difficulities.
 
  1. The oder of `subject`->`predicate`->`object` keeps the same in Chinese;
  2. In Chinese, `adverbial-1` can also placed in the beginning or in the end;
  3. The only difference is that `[subject](attribute-1) in Egnlish` sould be rserved as  `(attribute-1)[subject] in Chinese`, so is `(object)(attribute-2)` by the third item in the above Remarks. Similarly, `[predicate](adverbial-2) in English` is reordered as `(adverbial-2)[predicate] in Chinese`. 
From the above the discussion, the following formula about the structure of Chinese can be immediately derived from Formula 1.

**Formula 2:** The structure of any **Chinese** sentence satisfies

	(adverbial-1/attribute-1)[subject](adverbial-2)[predicate](attribute-2)(object)(adverbial-1)
	
## Main Result

Combing Formula 1 and Formula 2 yields our main result of this note.

* **Main Result:** There is a one-to-one relationship between **English** and **Chinese**. And the mapping from English to Chinese can be operated in three extremely easy steps, and vice versa:
 1. Fix and keep the order of the three elements:   `subject`->`predicate`->`object`;
 2. Fix `adverbial-1` in the beginning or the end of the sentence;
 3. Reorder `[subject](attribute-1)`, `[predicate](adverbial-2)` and `(object)(attribute-2)` in English to be `(attribute-1)[subject]`, `(adverbial-2)[predicate]` and `(attribute-2)(object)` in Chinese, respectively.
